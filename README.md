# Compiler for "Turing Complete" Computer

## Overview

This project is a custom compiler that translates a high-level language into machine code for a custom-built computer designed within the game *Turing Complete*.

## Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. **High-Level Compiler:** Transforms the high-level language into a custom assembly-like language optimized for the architecture.
2. **Low-Level Compiler:** Converts the assembly-like language into machine code specific for the custom-built computer.
3. **Emulator:** Simple emulator for the computer to simplify testing.

Additionally, a test example demonstrating the compiler's functionality is available in the `src/` directory.
